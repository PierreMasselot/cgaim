# 1.0.0

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a \dontrun statement for R CMD check to ignore the most computationally expensive example.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE on winbuilder only:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

New submission

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Groupwise (2:20)
  groupwise (10:31)

I believe these notes are just flagging the fact it is a new submission.
Regarding misspelled words, this is how these words are spelled and used in associated publications and are therefore correct.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
